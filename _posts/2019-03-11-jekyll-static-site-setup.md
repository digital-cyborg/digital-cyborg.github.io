# This is how we built this

We deploy static HTML files to our web host as this makes it difficult to attack by reducing the attack surface. We use Jekyll to create the site offline, and host using GitHub pages. This means that there's no hosting cost for the static site. Always more attractive than paying any fees.

What it does require is a little time to setup a local environment to create and test the site, and a web host for the deployment. We use GitHub Pages as it's free, well-known and works seamlessly.
