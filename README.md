### How to select the right tool for a task

Finding and using tools for a specific task is requires time. I determine how much time to spend evaluating the tools should be based on value of the time optimized using some metric such as how often the task is performed. Other influencing variables can be whether there the performance of the task is improved or made easier is some way e.g. a spell checker for text editing should be considered essential unless there is a secondary review. And tools change and are enhanced over time. How I evaluate text editors continues to influence the things that I try to consider when performing tool selection for a task. There are still times when there is some feature that makes a particular task easier to do using a specific tool. For example, using multiple cursors to perform the same sequence of edit actions on all rows of a csv file or using vi for remote editing of any text file. I used to aim to to vary my primary editor at different times, however am now considering using an IDE (I mean vs code) for all my text activities on my local desktop, with the aim of developing tools automate the creation and management of knowledge systems.
